# rlyeh-NetCore-Logger
This logger implementation is a lean and high-performance solution for text file or console logging.
Both can also be combined.

The whole thing is programmed on Linux, for Linux. 
Currently tested for .Net 7 and 8.

If you find a bug or have questions about the usage, please let me know.

You can see how the logger is used in the LoggerTester project.

The first beta version is branched v0.9.0
